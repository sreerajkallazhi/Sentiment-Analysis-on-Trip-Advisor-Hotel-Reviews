# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Trip-Advisor-Hotel-Reviews

 Here we are doing sentiment analysis on Tripadvisor Hotel reviews using two different techniques:
1) VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) - Bag of words approach
2) Roberta Pretrained Model from Hugging face
** Both are compared to get good insights

** We will look into Quick and Easy Transformers Pipeline too.

# Sentiment analysis using DistilBERT Model

The DistilBERT is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model trained by distilling BERT base. It has 40% less parameters than bert-base-uncased, runs 60% faster while preserving over 95% of BERTâ€™s performances as measured on the GLUE language understanding benchmark.
Here we use the model to analyse the sentiment precisely ['anger', 'sad', 'happy', 'excited' ] etc in large and small texts.
